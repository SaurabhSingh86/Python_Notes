<<<<<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   OOPs   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>>>>>

    =>  OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
    =>  An in-built data type that we have is not sufficient enough to deal with the real-world entity/object,
        to deal with a real-world entity we need a user-defined data type that is nothing but its class.

==>> class: Class is a plan/blueprint/design/idea/template to create an object.

==>> object: Physical Existence or Instance of a class in nothing but Object.

==>> Reference Variable: is a variable with the help of this we can access the properties/behaviors of an Object.


	The relationship between Class and Object is One to Many.
	from per Class we can create n number of Objects.
	from per Object we have n number of reference variable.

==>> self: Self is a reference variable that is used to create & access the instance variable inside the class.

==>> Constructor:
    1.	Constructor is also known as the special method,
    2.	Name of the constructor is always fixed i.e. __init__
    3.	Constructor gets executed automatically whenever we create an object.
    4.	Constructor is used to create an instance variable
    5.	Constructor is optional in nature, if we are not providing constructor then Python virtual machine is going to
        provide by default constructor.
        e.g
        class Demo:
            def sample(self):
                print("Python World")
        s=Demo()
        s.sample()          # Python World


class method is used for validate the data
